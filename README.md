## Description

Inspired by the retrofuturist aestethics of the 80s, Neuromancer and neon lights.
Hackerman has a dark background coupled with bright colors in order to achieve maximum readability.
I strongly recommend leaving the dark background unchanged, coupling it with a dark UI-theme.

## Contributing

If you want a particular syntax for a language either open an issue or fork/PR and I will be happy to implement your code.

If you have any suggestions, please don't hesitate to let me know.

Happy Coding!

to use it in other editors see my hackerman-contrib repository.
